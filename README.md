## ü§î How It Works

This project demonstrates the power of a fully serverless, "user-pays" application model using Puter.js.

1.  **Authentication:** The user authenticates using their Puter account. This grants the application secure, temporary access to the user's resources.
2.  **File Upload:** The resume is uploaded directly to the logged-in user's private Puter Drive.
3.  **API Call:** The frontend calls the `puter.ai.chat()` function, passing a reference to the uploaded file's path and a specific prompt for resume analysis.
4.  **Analysis:** The AI analysis is performed on behalf of the user, consuming *their* Puter account's AI credits.
5.  **Feedback:** The generated feedback is streamed back to the user's browser and displayed on the screen.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
    * Add your Puter App's Client ID to it. You can find this in your app's settings on puter.com.
    ```
    VITE_PUTER_CLIENT_ID=your-puter-app-client-id
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

6.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

## üö¢ Deployment

This application is designed for easy deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

1.  Import your Git repository into Vercel.
2.  Use the `Vite` framework preset.
3.  Verify the **Output Directory** is set to `dist`.
4.  **Crucially**, after your first deployment, you must add your Vercel URL (e.g., `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`) to the **Authorized Origins** list in your Puter App's settings to avoid CORS errors.
